House Rocket is a company that buys houses and sells them.

Currently, we need to find the best opportunities in our portfolio of houses, to get the best deals with the maximum profit.

Our team is not able to make the best decisisons without analysing data, because our datase is too big. Therefore, this project aims to help answering the business problems.

# 2. Business Assumptions

The assumptions about the business problem is as follows

- The whole database will be used
- No outliers were considered

# 3. Solution Strategy

My strategy to solve this challenge was:

**Step 01. Data Description:** My goal is to use statistics metrics to identify data outside the scope of business.

**Step 02. Feature Engineering:** Derive new attributes based on the original variables to better describe the phenomenon that will be modeled.

**Step 03. Data Filtering:** Filter rows and select columns that do not contain information for modeling or that do not match the scope of the business.

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning.
